# Web Performance and Accessibility Challenge

Welcome to the Web Performance and Accessibility Challenge.
This repository contains code for the website deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://netcentric.github.io/web-performance-challenge) that is full of web performance and accessibility bad practices.
Idea of the challenge is to find and fix as many issues as possible.

## How to do the challenge

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a GitHub page
3. Test the GitHub page URL with https://www.webpagetest.org/
4. Fix issues you find for page to be as accessible and fast as possible

Note: This challenge starts with main accessibility fix that is fixing code semantics. If you are here to do only performance part, you can start from 'semantic' branch. In this case, make sure you uncheck 'copy only main branch when forking repositiory' and to select 'semantic' as branch from which to deploy when setting up GitHub Pages.
